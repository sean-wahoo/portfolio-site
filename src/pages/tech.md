# Tech Stuff

---

I've got lots of experience with **ReactJS** and **NodeJS**. **JavaScript** it my go-to on both the front-end and the back-end, but I'm competent with **Python**, **SCSS**, and **PHP**.

For example, this website is made with **ReactJS** using **TypeScript** and is styled with **SCSS**.

When it comes to **DevOps**, I've got a pretty good head on my shoulders. I am experienced with **Git** and **Github** for version control and **Github Actions** for **CI/CD**.
