# About Sean

---

Hi. My name is **_Sean Reichel_** and I'm a **_web developer_**.

I've been building websites for around 2 years now and have used a large variety of
different technologies to do it.

In that time, I've won a few awards for IT in school and I got my **CompTIA Security+** certification.

In my free time, I like to mess with different Linux distributions and I play a lot of chess.
